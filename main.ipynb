    "Create an application that allows users to speak to GPT-3.5-turbo using the LangChain library and OpenAI API. The UI interface does not matter. The application should save previous conversation history into a memory (Chroma), and when a new conversation starts, it should retrieve previous conversations from memory and use them in the prompt to set the context."
